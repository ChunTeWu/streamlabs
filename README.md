The fonts source I used are from Google Fonts. 
Since it is not the exactly the same font source is Figma, there could be a very little difference between them. 

Animation is added on links and buttons, with hover and loop effect. 
Add script function to add background to the menu bar so it won't blend with other background, also another function to toggle the mobile menu.

It's mobile friendly.

This project is built under gulp version 3.9.1
